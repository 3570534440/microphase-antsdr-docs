## E316 GNU Radio

[[中文]](../../../cn/device_and_usage_manual/ANTSDR_E_Series_Module/ANTSDR_E316_Reference_Manual/AntsdrE316_gnurdio_cn.html)


### ●1. Overview
[Gnuradio](https://www.gnuradio.org/) is an open source software

[Gnuradio](https://www.gnuradio.org/) is a free software development kit that provides signal processing blocks for implementing software
defined radios and signal processing systems. It can be used with external RF hardware to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a simulation-like environment. It is widely used in amateur, academic, and commercial environments to support wireless communications research and real-world radio systems.

The GNURadio software provides a framework and tools for building and running software radios or just general signal processing applications. GNURadio applications themselves are often called "flowgraphs", which are a series of signal processing blocks connected together, describing the flow of data. These flowgraphs can be written in C++ or Python programming languages. The GNURadio infrastructure is written entirely in C++, while many user tools are written in Python.

As with all software-defined radio systems, reconfigurability is a key feature. GNU Radio's open interfaces make it easy to integrate users' own radio equipment into the GNU Radio ecosystem without designing for specific hardware.

### ●2. libiio installation on unutu
Different Ubuntu versions are different. You can refer to the installation materials for details:
[gnuradio install](https://wiki.analog.com/resources/tools-software/linux-software/gnuradio)
#### ○1. install system packages
Before installing the Pluto SDR driver, install the required dependencies and enter the following command
```
sudo apt install libxml2 libxml2-dev bison flex cmake git libaio-dev libboost-all-dev
sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev
sudo apt install libavahi-common-dev libavahi-client-dev
sudo apt install bison flex cmake git libgmp-dev
sudo apt install swig
sudo apt install liborc-dev
```
#### ○2. install libiio
You can find the latest version on [github](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libiio)

```
git clone -b v0.24 https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libiio.git
cd libiio
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
sudo make install
cd ../..
```
#### ○3. install libad9361-iio

```
git clone https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libad9361-iio.git
cd libad9361-iio
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
sudo make install
cd ../..

```
### ●3. gnuradio and gr-iio

#### install gr-iio
gr-iio in 3.8+ requires liborc-dev

```
(sudo) apt install liborc-dev
```
Build and install gr-iio from source:

```
git clone -b upgrade-3.8 https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/gr-iio.git
cd gr-iio
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr ..
make 
sudo make install
cd ..
sudo ldconfig
```
GNU radio 3.8.2 is already installed on the latest K UI perversion, not tiff or some reason have to install IT, here i show:
```
apt-get update
apt install gnuradio -y
ldconfig
```
For 3.8, make sure the gr-iio swig interface is on your PYTHONPATH. Otherwise, you will get import errors in python. The common command would be (depending on OS and install location):
```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/lib/python{PYTHON VERSION}/{site or dist}-packages
```
The added path is the location of the newly installed iio folder.
For 3.8.2 no additional steps have to be taken


#### gnuradio3.10

If you are using gnuradio 3.10 or newer, gr-iio is already provided in the base installation of gnuradio itself,No need to install gr-iio.

After all installations are complete, we can check the gnuradio version in the terminal
```
gnuradio-companion --help
```

### ●4. Using the Pluto blocks

Before use, you need to use the pluto firmware. You can find the pltuo firmware usage here [Unpacking examination](./AntsdrE310_Unpacking_examination.md)

You can find the antsdr gnuradio example here:
